# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction  A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease using health-related attributes from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
Project Objective
To build and evaluate a classification model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical and demographic features.

📊 Dataset
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Target Variable:
0 → No Heart Disease
1 → Heart Disease Present

Features Include:
Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Maximum Heart Rate
Exercise Induced Angina
ST Depression (oldpeak)
Number of Major Vessels
Thalassemia

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values
Handled missing data (if present)
Verified data types

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
